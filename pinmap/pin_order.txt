Pin ordering for input slot, left to right (increasing number at
Microzed).  This is and aid to defining the FPGA pin map, so only has
the digital signal lines, not supplies or analog.

Lines that are buffered or bussed low speed are included, but have *
prefix.  These lines are not in the pinmap, since they don't run
directly to the Microzen, but do still have to be broken out of the
card connector in the correct order.

The idea is to avoid any crossovers in the lines running to the
Microzed.  I'm using a system which is in some sense unnecessarily
strict, since we can do some crossovers during top/bottom flips that
have to happen anyway, but I see no benefit in exploting this freedom,
and there is likely some cost in degrading pair matching.
 -- The + of diff pair must always be on the left at the Microzed, so
    we fan out all pairs this way, even those that go to a buffer.
 -- We map out the pins so that, on the te two row microzed connector,
    the lower number (odd) pin or pin pair is used first.
 -- Single-ended lines are broken out in direct order, eg. 17, 18.
 -- Diff pairs are broken out pairwise, eg. 17, 19, 18, 20.

Rules that come from placement:
 -- Single-ended buffered outputs (SYNC, etc.) are mapped on the
    left. 
 -- The input slots are mapped in left-to-right (increasing) order. 
 -- Clock outputs are on the right
